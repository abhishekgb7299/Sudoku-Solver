# Sudoku-Solver
It is programmed using python, tkinter. Algorithm BRUTE FORCE is used.

ALGORITHM - BRUTE FORCE:

Starts setting to 0 all empty cells

Search the next cell to fill checking if is equal to 0

Tries 1-9 numbers until it finds the first correct one for that cell and puts the number into it

If going along it will find an error, it will recoursively delete all the inserted cells

It restarts the algorithm and repeats it until finds the correct numbers
